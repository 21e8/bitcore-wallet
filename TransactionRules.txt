Transaction Building Business Logic:

Inputs Needed:

1. list of utxos
2. list of output addresses (addresses to send to)
  a. each address may have a flag denoting whether is it a change address, DEFAULT: not a change address
  b. each address may optionally have a satoshi amount to send
  c. if a change address has an amount, it will be ignored
  d. if the sum of the input amounts plus the fee are LESS THAN the desired non-change output amounts, then the transaction will not be constructed without further user invention
    i. inAmount + fee < outAmount === error
  e. if the sum of the input amounts plus the fee are GREATER THAN the desired non-change output amounts, then the transaction will be constructed and the change address will be used for the difference
    i. inAmount + fee > outAmount === overflow to single change address
  d. if the sum of the input amounts plus the fee are EQUAL TO the desired non-change output amounts, then the transaction will be constructed and the change address will NOT be used
    i. inAmount + fee == outAmount === no error
  f. if an amount is set on output address(es), then then the sum of these non-change output amounts will take precedence over the maximum satoshis setting

Options explained:

Maximum Transaction Size <maxtxsize>: The maximum size for the transaction in the number of bytes. The Bitcoin protocol's theoretical maximum transaction size, pre-segregated witness, is 1 MB (1,000,000 bytes) if the number of signature operations is also equal to or less than 20,000. DEFAULT: 100 kB (100,000 bytes).

Fee Per Byte: <feeperbyte>: The exact amount of satoshis per byte in the transaction. This setting includes the signatures that may be applied at a later time. This tool supports inputs of pay-to-public-key-hash only. Therefore, it can use a conservative value of 72 bytes for the size of a ECDSA type digitial signature and one signature per input.

Maximum Satoshis: <maxsatoshis>: The maximum amount of bitcoin, in satoshis, to make available to the non-change output addresses. This value will override the output amounts used in the input file.

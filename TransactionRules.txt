Transaction Building Business Logic:

Inputs Needed:

1. list of utxos
2. list of output addresses (addresses to send to)
  a. each address may have a flag denoting whether is it a change address, DEFAULT: not a change address
  b. each address may optionally have a satoshi amount to send
  c. if a change address has an amount, it will be ignored
  d. inAmount < outAmount + fee === error
  e. inAmount > outAmount + fee === overflow to single change address
  f. inAmount + fee == outAmount === no error
  g. if an amount is set on output address(es), then then the sum of these non-change output amounts will take precedence over the maximum satoshis setting

Options explained:

* Maximum Transaction Size -s <maxtxsize>: The maximum size for the transaction in the number of bytes. The Bitcoin protocol's theoretical maximum transaction size, pre-segregated witness, is 1 MB (1,000,000 bytes) if the number of signature operations is also equal to or less than 20,000. DEFAULT: 100 kB (100,000 bytes).

* Fee Per Byte -f <feeperbyte>: The exact amount of satoshis per byte in the transaction. This setting includes the signatures that may be applied at a later time. This tool supports inputs of pay-to-public-key-hash only. Therefore, it can use a conservative value of 72 bytes for the size of a ECDSA type digitial signature and one signature per input. DEFAULT: will use a dynamic fee per byte chosen by 21.co's fee calculator and/or Insight's fee estimator, whichever is available and has a lower estimate.

* Maximum Satoshis -a <maxamount>: The maximum amount of bitcoin to make available to the non-change output addresses. This value will override the output amounts used in the input file. DEFAULT: 50 BTC

* Priority -p <priority>: The priority level, from 1 to 3, with 3 being the lowest priority. Generally, the highest priority (1) aims to have your transaction confirmed within the next 2 blocks. A priority of 2 should confirm in 3 blocks and so on. DEFAULT: Priority 2.
